## Project title shown in the generated documentation.
## Surrounding quotes are optional but keep them for names with spaces.
PROJECT_NAME = "Linux 2.4.18 MM"

## Directories and/or files that Doxygen will scan for source.
## You can specify multiple paths separated by spaces. Relative paths are
## evaluated from the location where doxygen is run.
INPUT = mm/ include/linux/

## File name patterns to include. Doxygen will only parse files that match
## these patterns (simple glob-style patterns). Add extensions if needed.
FILE_PATTERNS = *.c *.h

## If YES, Doxygen will recurse into subdirectories of the INPUT paths.
## Useful when you want to document an entire tree without listing each dir.
RECURSIVE = YES

## If YES, document all entities found in the source files even when they
## lack explicit documentation comments. This is helpful for exploring a
## legacy codebase where not everything is annotated.
EXTRACT_ALL = YES
## Show TODOsnd FIXMEs in docs
EXTRACT_TODO = YES

## Enable use of Graphviz 'dot' to generate diagrams (call graphs, class
## diagrams). Requires the 'dot' program on PATH.
HAVE_DOT = YES

## Enable generation of call graphs & caller graphs(which functions call which). This
## requires HAVE_DOT = YES to actually produce graphs.
CALL_GRAPH = YES
##CALLER_GRAPH = YES

## Output directory where generated documentation will be written. If the
## directory does not exist Doxygen will create it.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = docs

## --- Preprocessing and C-specific parsing ---------------------------------
## Enable C preprocessing so macros and conditional compilation are handled.
## This helps Doxygen see the real declarations in kernel headers.
ENABLE_PREPROCESSING = YES

## Expand simple macros. Useful for kernel code that uses many macros.
MACRO_EXPANSION = YES

## If YES, only macros listed in PREDEFINED are expanded. We want general
## expansion so leave this NO (the default). Set to YES to limit expansion.
EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF = NO

## Common kernel macros so preprocessing behaves more like the kernel build.
## Add more symbols here if you find other conditional blocks are skipped.
PREDEFINED = __KERNEL__ MODULE

## Tell Doxygen to optimize output for C code (not C++). This enables some
## C-specific parsing choices that match kernel coding patterns.
OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C = YES

## Treat the first line of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief description.
## The kernel uses many brief-style comments; enabling this makes parsing
## more likely to attach comments to the right entity.
JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = YES

## --- Source browsing & inline sources ------------------------------------
## Show the cross-referenced source code in the generated documentation.
## SOURCE_BROWSER creates separate source pages; INLINE_SOURCES embeds the
## actual source (with comments) into the documentation for each symbol.
SOURCE_BROWSER = YES
INLINE_SOURCES = YES

## When showing the source in docs, do NOT strip code comments — we want
## the comments to be visible inline alongside the code.
STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS = NO

## Also extract static functions/variables so local (file-scoped) symbols
## are documented and their comments are visible.
EXTRACT_STATIC = YES

## Add common include paths so preprocessing can find kernel headers. These
## are relative to where doxygen is run; adjust if you run doxygen differently.
INCLUDE_PATH = include include/linux mm
