description: "Simplified callflow for a user-space read page fault."
entrypoint: "do_page_fault"
steps:
  - function: "do_page_fault"
    file: "arch/i386/mm/fault.c"
    notes: "The main entry point for handling page faults on x86. It identifies the faulting address and determines if it's a valid access."
    calls: "handle_mm_fault"
  - function: "handle_mm_fault"
    file: "mm/memory.c"
    notes: "Finds the appropriate VMA for the faulting address and checks its permissions."
    calls: "do_wp_page"
  - function: "do_wp_page"
    file: "mm/memory.c"
    notes: "Handles copy-on-write (COW) faults. If the page is shared, it allocates a new page and copies the data."
    calls: "alloc_page"
  - function: "alloc_page"
    file: "include/linux/mm.h"
    notes: "A wrapper macro that eventually calls into the buddy allocator to get a free physical page frame."
    calls: "alloc_pages"
